This is a linear model for estimating MPG for cars. The model depends on 4 parameters: 1. Transmission type (manual or automatic), 2. Number of cylinders in the engine (4, 6, or 8), 3. Weight of the car (keep in mind it is in 1000lb, e.g., enter 2 for 2000lb), and 4. Horse power of the car. This application has two panels as output. In the first panel (Result), the estimated MPG and the confidence interval is given. In the second panel, we provide a representaton of the confidence interval in green color. The user has a chance to specify the confidence interval via the sliding bar.
